## Lyrics

```

breee
breee aye

nirmita
i come from the mind
i come from the side
i come from a world

nirmita
i come from the mind
i come from the side
i come from a world
hold hold up not of blight this time

nirmita
step into continuum of the mindstream alight 
citta-santƒÅna for the blind

my eyes are so wide
my eyes not afraid
lids like a tonna
truth be like flood
throughout and cuts on my spine
rising to meet the light
and be all gone 
during the night

born from thought
ready to walk
the earth for a night



neever been
pulling to cops
grey on grey
blending the walls
painting the walls
news flash 

whole worlds of projection are yours
your treachery
you're a tulpa

```
